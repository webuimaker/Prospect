                <p>A job is a key part of a person's physical, mental, and emotional well-being. Unfortunately, too many people face barriers to employment.</p>
                <p>Prospect works with everyone from recent immigrants to ill-and-injured military veterans to people with disabilities. We're a not-for-profit organization, but our main motivation isn't charity. We believe everyone who is ready, willing and able to work and wants a fulfilling job should have one. We're driven to help people who face barriers to employment because society reaps the benefits for years to come.</p>
